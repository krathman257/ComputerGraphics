# Project 2

This program renders a scene in outer space, featuring a gas planet, an Earth-like planet, and a moon. The purpose is to demonstrate the usage of two main graphical features, being reflective surfaces and perlin noise.

## Usage

Starting the program will create a terminal prompt asking for a resolution to render at and various features to be enabled or disabled.
The resolution must be two integers separated by a space.
The features can be take either a 0 or a 1 as input.

Once the program has its arguments, the image will be rendered. Progress is shown as a floating point percent continuously being printed by the console. The final image will be saved as "RenderedImage.bmp" in the same directory as the executable.

## Example Input

Enter a resolution to be rendered at (Suggest 320 240, 800 600, 2048 1536):

800 600

Simple or detailed model? (0=Simple, 1=Detailed)

1

Normal smoothing? (0=No, 1=Yes)


0

Reflections? (0=No, 1=Yes)

## Notes

Rendering can take a long time, particularly with the detailed model. At 2048X1536, an image with the detailed model, normal smoothing and reflections took around 90 minutes to render, though at lower resolutions, rendering can take less than 1 minute.
